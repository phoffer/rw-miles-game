# README

This is a read only front end to the RWOL 2015in2015 game. It's mostly only to view the team scoring as players post their miles.

# TODO

* Make it look nice
* Add ability to update team rosters, not through web interface though
* If more is desired out of it, build it again with Rails and ActiveRecord.
